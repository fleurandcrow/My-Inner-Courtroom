Tim: You've been reading the same book over and over again. Doesn't that ever get boring?
Julia: No it doesn't. When I read it, I always discover new things I didn't notice during my previous reading. Besides, you always read those boring research papers, I bet you're more bored than I am.
Tim: Seriously, what's got you so interested in that particular book when there's so many other ones about astronomy?
Julia: This? It's the last gift my mom ever gave to me.
Julia: My dad says that she was very passionate about astronomy... So I guess I read it cause I wanna relate to her in some way!
The bell rings.
Julia: Oh! It's time for PE! Gotta get going!
